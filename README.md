# Bing Ads Data Unification

This dbt package is for the Bing Ads data unification Ingested by [Daton](https://sarasanalytics.com/daton/). [Daton](https://sarasanalytics.com/daton/) is the Unified Data Platform for Global Commerce with 100+ pre-built connectors and data sets designed for accelerating the eCommerce data and analytics journey by [Saras Analytics](https://sarasanalytics.com).

### Supported Datawarehouses:
- BigQuery
- Snowflake

#### Typical challanges with raw data are:
- Array/Nested Array columns which makes queries for Data Analytics complex
- Data duplication due to look back period while fetching report data from Bing Ads
- Seperate tables at marketplaces/Store, brand, account level for same kind of report/data feeds

By doing Data Unification the above challenges can be overcomed and simplifies Data Analytics. 
As part of Data Unification, the following funtions are performed:
- Consolidation - Different marketplaces/Store/account & different brands would have similar raw Daton Ingested tables, which are consolidated into one table with column distinguishers brand & store
- Deduplication - Based on primary keys, the data is De-duplicated and the latest records are only loaded into the consolidated stage tables
- Incremental Load - Models are designed to include incremental load which when scheduled would update the tables regularly
- Standardization -
	- Currency Conversion (Optional) - Raw Tables data created at Marketplace/Store/Account level may have data in local currency of the corresponding marketplace/store/account. Values that are in local currency are standardized by converting to desired currency using Daton Exchange Rates data.
	  Prerequisite - Exchange Rates connector in Daton needs to be present - Refer [this](https://github.com/saras-daton/currency_exchange_rates)
	- Time Zone Conversion (Optional) - Raw Tables data created at Marketplace/Store/Account level may have data in local timezone of the corresponding marketplace/store/account. DateTime values that are in local timezone are standardized by converting to specified timezone using input offset hours.

#### Prerequisite 
Daton Integrations for  
- Bing Ads 
- Exchange Rates(Optional, if currency conversion is not required)

*Note:* 
*Please select 'Do Not Unnest' option while setting up Daton Integrataion*

```yaml
vars:
    raw_database: "your_database"
    raw_schema: "your_schema"
```

## Setting Target Schema

Models will be create unified tables under the schema (<target_schema>_stg_bingads). In case, you would like the models to be written to the target schema or a different custom schema, please add the following in the dbt_project.yml file.

```yaml
models:
  bing_ads:
    +schema: custom_schema_extension
```

## Optional Variables

Package offers different configurations which must be set in your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables can be marked as True/False based on your requirements. Details about the variables are given below.

Example:
```yaml
vars:
